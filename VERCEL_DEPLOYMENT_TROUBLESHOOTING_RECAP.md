# Vercel Deployment Troubleshooting - Complete Recap

## 🚨 **Current Status: Build Successful, Still 404 Error**

The Vercel build is completing successfully with all 9 pages generated, but the deployed site still shows a 404 error.

## 📋 **Everything We've Tried**

### 1. **Initial Vercel Configuration Issues**
- ❌ **Problem**: Invalid `rootDirectory` property in `vercel.json`
- ✅ **Fix**: Removed `rootDirectory` property
- ❌ **Result**: Still 404

### 2. **Dependency Conflicts**
- ❌ **Problem**: `npm ERESOLVE` errors with TypeScript ESLint packages
- ✅ **Fix**: Downgraded `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin` from `7.0.0` to `^6.21.0`
- ✅ **Fix**: Downgraded `@typescript-eslint/parser` from `7.0.0` to `^6.21.0`
- ✅ **Fix**: Downgraded `eslint` from `9.24.0` to `^8.57.0`
- ❌ **Result**: Build succeeded, still 404

### 3. **Vercel Builds Configuration**
- ❌ **Problem**: `builds` configuration overriding Vercel project settings
- ✅ **Fix**: Simplified `vercel.json` to remove `builds` configuration
- ❌ **Result**: Still 404

### 4. **Directory Structure Issues**
- ❌ **Problem**: Next.js app in `app/` subdirectory causing path issues
- ✅ **Fix**: Moved all files from `app/` to root directory
- ✅ **Fix**: Updated `vercel.json` to use root directory commands
- ❌ **Result**: Still 404

### 5. **App Router vs Pages Router Conflicts**
- ❌ **Problem**: Mixed router structure causing build issues
- ✅ **Fix**: Moved all files to proper `app/` directory for App Router
- ✅ **Fix**: Removed `pages/` directory to eliminate conflicts
- ✅ **Fix**: Excluded `scripts/` directory from TypeScript compilation
- ✅ **Fix**: Fixed CSS import paths
- ❌ **Result**: Build successful, still 404

### 6. **Build Cache Issues**
- ❌ **Problem**: Stale build cache causing conflicts
- ✅ **Fix**: Removed `.next` and `node_modules`, reinstalled dependencies
- ❌ **Result**: Clean build, still 404

## 🔍 **Current Build Status (SUCCESSFUL)**

```
✓ Compiled successfully
✓ Generating static pages (9/9)
✓ Build Completed in /vercel/output [1m]
✓ Deployment completed
```

**Generated Routes:**
- `○ /` (Static) - 146 B
- `○ /_not-found` (Static) - 873 B  
- `ƒ /api/gems/live` (Dynamic) - 0 B
- `ƒ /api/gems/sentiment` (Dynamic) - 0 B
- `○ /api/test` (Static) - 0 B
- `○ /simple` (Static) - 146 B
- `○ /test` (Static) - 146 B

## 🤔 **Possible Remaining Issues**

### 1. **Vercel Project Settings**
- The Vercel project might have incorrect settings in the dashboard
- Root Directory might be set incorrectly
- Framework detection might be wrong

### 2. **Domain/Routing Issues**
- The domain might not be properly configured
- There might be a redirect issue
- The deployment might be on a different URL

### 3. **Next.js Configuration**
- The `next.config.js` might have issues
- Static export settings might be wrong
- Base path or asset prefix issues

### 4. **Vercel Caching**
- Vercel might be serving cached 404 responses
- The deployment might not be properly invalidating cache

## 🛠️ **Next Steps to Try**

### 1. **Check Vercel Dashboard Settings**
- Verify Root Directory is set to `.` (current directory)
- Check if Framework is set to Next.js
- Verify Build Command and Output Directory

### 2. **Try Different Vercel Configuration**
```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "package.json",
      "use": "@vercel/next"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 3. **Check Deployment URLs**
- Try accessing the deployment URL directly
- Check if there are multiple deployment URLs
- Verify the correct production URL

### 4. **Force Cache Invalidation**
- Add a new commit with a timestamp
- Try redeploying from Vercel dashboard
- Check if there are multiple deployments

### 5. **Simplify to Minimal Test**
- Create a completely minimal Next.js app
- Test if the basic structure works
- Gradually add complexity

## 📊 **Build Evidence**

The build logs show:
- ✅ All 9 pages generated successfully
- ✅ Static pages created correctly
- ✅ API routes configured
- ✅ No compilation errors
- ✅ Build completed successfully

**This suggests the issue is NOT with the build process, but with Vercel's serving/routing configuration.**

## 🎯 **Most Likely Cause**

Given that the build is completely successful, the issue is likely:
1. **Vercel project settings** in the dashboard
2. **Domain/routing configuration**
3. **Caching issues** on Vercel's side

The fact that all static pages are being generated correctly means the Next.js app is working perfectly - the issue is in how Vercel is serving the built files.
